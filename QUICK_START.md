# 🚀 PSU Attendance App - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ App is Ready!

Your Flutter app is now fully configured and ready to run. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Set Up Database (Required)
Before the app can work, you need to set up the Supabase database:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ooxojxeiqvasqhyxrdvk
2. **Open SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. **Copy and paste** the entire content from `database_schema.sql`
4. **Click "Run"** to execute the SQL
5. **Go to Authentication → Settings**
6. **Disable "Email confirmations"** (since we use phone numbers as emails)

### 2. Run the App
```bash
# Run on Chrome (recommended)
flutter run -d chrome

# Or run on Windows desktop
flutter run -d windows

# Or run on Edge browser
flutter run -d edge
```

### 3. Test the App
1. **Register** a new teacher account
2. **Login** with your credentials

## 📊 Database Schema

The app uses two main tables:

- **attendance** - Student attendance records

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the app won't start:
1. Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`
2. Check that Chrome is installed and updated
3. Verify your internet connection

### If database errors occur:
1. Make sure you ran the complete SQL schema
2. Check that email confirmations are disabled in Supabase
3. Verify your Supabase project is active

### If authentication fails:
1. Check your Supabase URL and anon key
2. Ensure the database tables exist
3. Verify RLS policies are set up correctly
